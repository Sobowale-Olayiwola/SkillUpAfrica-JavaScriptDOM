# Explain first-class and second-class citizens

## First-class citizen

First-class citizen (also type, object, entity, or value) in a given programming language is an entity which supports 

all the operations generally available to other entities.

These operations typically include being passed as an argument, returned from a function, modified, and assigned to a 

variable. E.g just as the case of JavaScript functions, which can be passed as an argument, modified, returned from 

a function just as in the case of closures and also assigned to a variable.

## Second-class citizen

Second-class citizens is an entity of which the value can be passed as a parameter, but that can neither be returned 

from a function, nor be assigned to a variable. It is synonymous to second-class objects, second-class values and 

second-class entity.
